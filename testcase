08:56:43 PM Chaoran: this is the new log agent currently using 08:58:36 PM Chaoran: I would suggest 
1. confirm the route on the VPC and make sure there is no Internet routing conflict for VPC route table rtb-3383fe4b 
2. migrate to the new log agent to replace the old one 08:58:55 PM Chaoran: what do you think? 
09:01:09 PM c61174aws: I am 100 percent agreeing with you on migrating to the new cloudwatch agent. I need to discuss with my team about VPC Routetables.

09:01:26 PM Chaoran: sure

09:03:22 PM Chaoran: there is a .exe wizard to do everything which is much more convenient.

1. IAM role has enough permission
